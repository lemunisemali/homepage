            	<h2>Ladi Semali’s Teaching Philosophy at Penn State University</h2>
            	<div class="text">
            	  <p align="justify"><span>As you become familiar with my CV, you will notice that a distinctive feature of my work—teaching, research, and service—has in large part focused on the study of Adult education in its many emphases—theories, non-formal (out-of-school) and informal (place-based and indigenous) learning environments.</span></p>
            	  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
            	  <p align="justify">You will notice also in my CV that during my tenure at Penn State, since 1992, I have engaged in a variety of academic activities which span the areas of teaching and advising, both undergraduate and graduate students in Curriculum and Instruction, specializing in teaching and curriculum. I also teach and advise at the graduate level in our Dual Title degree program in Comparative and International Education, to which I was Chair from 2003 - 2010.</p>
            	  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
            	  <p align="justify">As you will notice from my writing, one of the preoccupations of my teaching and research, for the past decade or so, has been to try to help shift the way “literacy” education has been conceptualized, namely from an individual psychologistic focus to one that is socially, culturally and historically contextualized.  In pursuing this research interest, I seek to explore literacy learning as an inter-subjective process. This area of research seeks to understand the “subjective” responses which are shared, to a degree, by all members of a culture.  By examining how inter-subjectivity is socially and culturally determined, and how it employs language, for example, my research explores the ways in which cultural influences affect individuals in any culture, and through which cultural membership is expressed through language—both linguistically and through media.</p>
            	  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
            	  <p align="justify">The principles framing the courses I teach emerge from sustained reflection and thinking derived from contemporary research on knowledge production, critical theory, postcolonial theories of subjugated knowledges, and radical curriculum theory. My instructional goals follow a process-oriented instruction method that is focused upon critical pedagogy and the construction of meaning in the communities students come from and the classrooms they attend. This thinking is reflected in my own scholarly research and published work in refereed journals and books.  Most notable are my two volumes, <em>What is indigenous knowledge? Voices from the Academy (Garland) and Literacy in Multimedia America: Integrating Media Education across the Curriculum (Routledge / Falmer)</em>.  As I continue to seek ways to infuse a student-centered teaching methodology and critical pedagogical practices into my teaching and reflective practice, I am inspired by the works of Michel Foucault on power and knowledge, Paulo Freire’s empowerment and transformative education, Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of cultural capital, and Antonio Gramsci’s notions of resistance. Giroux’s ideas of the hidden curriculum, Kincheloe and Steinberg’s post-formal theory, and Michael Apple’s critique of curriculum as official knowledge drive the theoretical context of my scholarship.  Collectively, these works have influenced my understanding of educational process and informed my thinking about educational theory and curriculum practice. </p>
            	  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
            	  <p align="justify">Clearly, the lessons I draw from this method of teaching and learning shape my own philosophy about teaching and are unique in the manner in which they promote the habits of questioning, inquiry, reflection, and action that enables students to question, resist or reject hegemonic practices or ideologies embedded in the textbooks and mass media texts they consume every day. The lessons involve an examination of how multiple symbolic forms are wielded to communicate particular visions and exclude other potential visions, to value foreign or outside practices and devalue homegrown or indigenous ones.  This particular way of teaching and learning is critical in classrooms of diverse learners and classrooms of non-native speakers of English, particularly in international education settings.              </p>
