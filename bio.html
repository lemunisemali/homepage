        	  <h2>Biographical Sketch</h2>
            	<div class="text">
            	  <div align="justify"><span>Dr. Semali is a comparative and international education professor at the Pennsylvania State University, Learning Performance and Systems specializing in Comparative Ways of Knowing and Learning.</span> <br />
            	    
          	    </div>
            	  <p align="justify">In past several years, he has held positions in the Curriculum and Instruction Department, specializing in curriculum theory, media literacy education, comparative and international education and non-Western educational epistemologies. Dr. Semali served as chair of Comparative and International Education, www.ed.psu./cied/ at Penn State and Co-director of the Inter-institutional Consortium for Indigenous Knowledge (ICIK) (www.ed.psu.edu/icik), which is part of a global network comprised of thirty indigenous knowledge resource centers in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. ICIK's signature program that Dr. Semali directs is an international conference that convenes every three years to involve people in deliberations on indigenous ways of knowing and learning activities from around the world. This conference is informed by courses taught every semester and retreats held in the off years when the annual conference is not convened. Semali has extensive experience in organizing internships and workshops for students in Africa, and is currently directing research in East Africa on the UN Millennium Development Goals (a set of targets for cutting poverty, disease, and hunger by the year 2015), social networks, digital media, and the use of mobile devices for education development. </p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="justify">Semali's comparative research and teaching interests include Higher Education, Comparative and International Education, Adult Education, communications media and the use of technology to enhance and develop curriculum. He teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in Language and Literacy Education; Media Literacy in the Classroom; Perspectives in Intercultural Communication in Multicultural settings; Cross-Cultural Research Methods in Education; Epistemological Issues in Indigenous and Ecological Literacies; Perspectives in African Education; and courses in Comparative and International Education. </p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="justify">His recent projects in Africa include engaging private universities in capacity building and development of iSPACES, an innovative way of rethinking science education in Tanzania that involves the integration of indigenous knowledge, innovation, and entrepreneurship. </p>
                  <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
                  <p align="justify">To accomplish his research, Dr. Semali works with graduate students and colleagues at Penn State University--and beyond on the following:</p>
                  <div align="justify">
                    <ol>
                      <li>Building Collaborative Research Activities: Over the past 5 years, Semali has been working with newly established universities in Africa to assist with Building Research Capacity and Colaboration. In a study called Challenges and Policy Responses in Science Education in Tanzania, I work with faculty and students at Tumaini and Mwenge Universities (Tanzania) to examine ways to address the barriers that prevent women students from taking science subjects and designing an integrated curriculum that fuses indigenous (local) knowledge, innovation, and entrepreneurship and that is informed by Informal Science. <br />
                      </li>
                      <li>At TAPRI, (the Tanzania Pests Research Institute, Arusha, Tanzania) Semali has worked with a team of researchers to develop and research agenda that establishes TAPRI's brand, plan a post bachelorette seminars and certificate programs for field officers and prospective employees. <br />
                      </li>
                      <li>Postliteracy Education. I work with graduate students and colleagues to investigate in a comparative study uses of the ubiquitous proliferation of cell phones and how this innovation interfaces with enhancement of literacy skills beyond school or adult literacy campaigns. <br />
                      </li>
                      <li>Comparative Ways of Knowing and Learning. I work with Continuing Education to study ways comparative ways of knowing and learning among diverse indigenous communities in USA, Africa and Central America. Scholars take part in field experiences that immerse them in situ to study the environment, culture and indigenous knowledge. New field experiences are being designed to involve participants in the Great Lakes Region, Tanzania, Uganda, Namibia, South Africa, and Costa Rica. <br />
                      </li>
                      <li>Informal Science. A team of researchers is hard at work designing opportunities for secondary school teachers enrolled at Mwenge University to establish out of school activities involving informal science as a venue for developing (a) lesson plans that integrate indigenous science, innovation, and entrepreneurship; (b) activities that encourage students to participate in out-of-school activities involving informal sciences; (c) develop everyday science school kits to illustrate for secondary school students how science-related practices fit into their fit into their everyday activities. We probe some of the contradictions and dilemmas that teachers face in teaching science, why women are socialized to believe that STEM subjects are difficult and therefore not fit for them; what it means to &quot;do science&quot; as opposed to &quot;studying science.&quot; How do the notions of &quot;science&quot; and &quot;scientists&quot; disrupt or influence women's views about themselves and their abilities?  </li>
